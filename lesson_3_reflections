When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is useful in case anything happened to your computer, or you don't 
have it with you when you want to access and edit the files. Since they are saved remotely, you 
can log into github and access them from any computer, and later copy them on your personal 
computer from the remote repository.
