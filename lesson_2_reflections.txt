What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, the repository is created, but it has no commits yet, and therefore no commit history.
Any files in the repository are listed as untracked files. You need to make the first commit to continue to use git 
for keeping track of the changes you make. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you can arrange the files you're thinking of making a commit for, letting you double check 
them before actually making the commit.
